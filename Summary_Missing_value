##The mean and the median stay the same, however the 1st quantile of the new data slides closer to the mean. When we look at the standard deviation values, we can also observe that the new data has a smaller standard deviation, thus the effect of imputing NAs with the mean values for the time intervals is a decrease in the spread, we obtained a distribution that is more concentrated around the center of gravity.
