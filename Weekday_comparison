##Here is the process for finding a comparison between weekend and weekday.
newData$day <- ifelse(weekdays(newData$date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")

##this assigns the value of each step to a day. Next we create 2 subsets
wkend <- filter(newData, day == "weekend")
wkday <- filter(newData, day == "weekday")

##Next we create the intervals for the subsets so they have a designed value.
wkend <- wkend %>%
      group_by(interval) %>%
      summarize(mean.steps = mean(steps)) 
wkend$day <- "weekend"

wkday <- wkday %>%
      group_by(interval) %>%
      summarize(mean.steps = mean(steps)) 
wkday$day <- "weekday"

newInterval <- rbind(wkend, wkday)
newInterval$day <- as.factor(newInterval$day)
newInterval$day <- relevel(newInterval$day, "weekend")

##Next create a plot.
g <- ggplot (newInterval, aes (interval, mean.steps))
g + geom_line() + facet_grid (day~.) + theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
      axis.title = element_text(size = 14)) + labs(y = "Number of Steps") + labs(x = "Interval")
      
##We observe that, as expected, the activity profiles between weekdays and weekends greatly differ. 
##During the weekdays, activity peaks in the morning between 7 and 9 and then the activity remains below ~100 steps. 
##In contrast, the weekend data does not show a period with particularly high level of activity, but the activity remains higher than the weekday activity at most times and in several instances 
##it surpases the 100 steps mark and it is overall more evenly distributed throughout the day.
